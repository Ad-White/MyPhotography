              <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                  My first experiences with photography as I grew up, involved old campact, film cameras.
                  I just loved "playing" with them. Hoping to get good results, but usually they were terrible!
                </p>  
                <p>
                  At college I completed a City & Guilds, Introduction to Black & White Photography.
                  A great experience, using an SLR for the first time and a darkroom to process the results.
                </p>
                <p>It was a few years after college that I learned of and became interested in digital photography.
                  In its early days and just becoming accessable to the average person, like myself. 
                  I wanted to know how it worked and I really wanted to try it!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once I got myself a camera, and photo editing software. I learned what I could through reading books and magazines,
                  and just by giving it a go.

              <h3>Cameras I've Used</h3>
              <p>
                My first digital compact camera was a Kodak Easyshare dx7630. 6.1 MP! I absolutely loved it.
                Old by todays standards, back in 2004 it was considered pretty good.
              </p>
              <p>
                My first D-SLR is a Canon EOS 550d. I've had it a while, and still enjoy using it now. 
              </p>   
              <p>My Mobile Phone Camera. I've used a number of different mobile cameras as my phones have upgraded over the years.
                Nothing beats the benefit of having a camera with me, when I want/need it. 
                It's probably the camera I use most often, as it's the most convenient!

                I soon hope to add more photographs to the existing galleries.
                And in due course, I shall add more category sections.
