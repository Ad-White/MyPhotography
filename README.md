# My Photography - Adam White

This website is for people to visit in order to view and enjoy a range of photographs, which have been taken by myself.

My photography has been a hobby and past-time I have enjoyed over the years, and continue to do so.
So I want to create a place for people to go and to enjoy what I've captured and created over time.

The audience I am expecting/targeting will consist mainly of family, friends and people I already know. 
And just in general, to expect anyone that may like to view my photographic collection.

Therefore, I have chosen to name it, "My Photography - Adam White".

## User Experience (UX)

My intention is to create a visually pleasing website for my visitors to experience.

I would like for people to easily navigate throughout the different pages of the site.

I would like for people to easily select a category of photography to look through and enjoy.

I would like them to want to return to my site again, in the future, as new photographs are added to my gallery.

So, I would like to have a comments/feedback form, along with the possiblity for them to opt into receiving notification
of any new photographic additions I have made to the galleries.

I would also like a page, where I can provide information, as to a little about myself and my photography.

I would like the potential for users to be able to connect via social media.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I have chosen a fairly monochromatic group of colours. Which has helped to provide good contrast, so I can promote the photographic content being displayed. To maximise the colours within them, and not 'fight' against the colours of the site itself.
I've selected to use a vibrant blue to act as a high light. Eye catching without being over bearing. 

- `eae8ff` used for primary text.
- `#23e0e7` used for primary highlights.
- `#eae8ff` used for secondary text.
- `#ade1e5` used for secondary highlights.
- `#0e1116` used for primary background.
- `#54645e` used for secondary background.
- `#eae8ff` used for optional secondary background.

I have used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/eae8ff-54645e-0e1116-23e0e7-ade1e5) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

- [Cormorant Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cormorant+Garamond) was used for the primary site name.

- [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Average Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Average+Sans) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used, such as the social media icons in the footer.
